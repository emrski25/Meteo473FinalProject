    "#### This project presents a potential methodology for calculating a 'Hurricane Severity Index'. We have gathered a few different ECMWF model runs that range from a low risk tropical storm to a hurricane that can cause major damage. Along with that, bouncing between different variables that include wind speed, surface pressure, precipitation can prove helpful to emergency planners, utility managers, and insurers in assessing the potential impact of hurricanes and tropical storms."

    "This tutorial demonstrated how meteorological variables can be synthesized into a Hurricane/Tropical Storm Severity Index, offering a quantifiable means of assessing storm impact. This methodology can be adapted for operational use to improve situational awareness and inform emergency management decision-making during severe weather events.\n",

    "- Explore different models outside of the ECMWF and what is included within Herbie\n",
    "- Calibrate with more past events to see if our severity index can match with what has already been recorded.\n",
