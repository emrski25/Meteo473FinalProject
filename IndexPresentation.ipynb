We have gathered a few different ECMWF model runs that range from a low risk tropical storm to a hurricane that can cause major damage. Along with that, bouncing between different variables that include wind speed, surface pressure, precipitation can prove helpful to emergency planners, utility managers, and insurers in assessing the potential impact of hurricanes and tropical storms."

    "- Vorticity: Vorticity measures the spin of the air in the storm, helping us understand the storm’s organization and intensity. Higher vorticity often indicates a more organized storm, which is linked to stronger winds and potentially more damage.\n",
    "- Surface Pressure: Low surface pressure is a key feature of tropical storms, and when pressure drops, it typically means the storm is strengthening. Monitoring surface pressure helps us track how the storm is evolving over time.\n",

While the index is still in its early stages, it has shown potential in identifying areas of concern during tropical events.\n",
