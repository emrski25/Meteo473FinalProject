# Meteo473 Final Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and data for the **Meteo473 Final Project**, where we analyze ECMWF models to develop a severity index for tropical events. Our main goal was to pull certain data out of entire model runs, and display it in plots easier readability/ease of understanding.

### Objectives:
- Develop a custom **Severity Index** to assess the intensity of weather events.
- Implement functions for easier plotting due to volume of data displayed.
- Utilize multiple plotting techniques to display standardization of the different components incorporated into the **Severity Index**.

## What We Accomplished

- Designed and implemented a **Severity Index** that incorporates the parameters of wind, precipitation, vorticity, and pressure.
- Built a set of **Python scripts** for data manipulation and visualization using libraries such as `xarray`, `matplotlib`, and `cartopy`.
- Created a **user-friendly interface** to visualize and interpret weather severity across multiple forecast hours.
