# Meteo473 Final Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and data for the **Meteo473 Final Project**, with the primary goal of development of a **Severity Index** for tropical events. We developed said index to allow for analyzation of different severity events, and tested it on three different events within the last two hurricane seasons. The model we used for this project was the ECWMF, where we pulled full model runs 0-240 for all three. Using those model runs, we pulled out specific data that aligned with our **Severity Index** and display said data in panels of plots for easier readability/understanding.

### Objectives:
- Develop a custom **Severity Index** to assess the intensity of tropical events, based off of wind, precipitation, vorticity, and pressure.
- Implement functions for easier plotting due to volume of data displayed.
- Utilize multiple plotting techniques to display standardization of the different components incorporated into the **Severity Index**.

## What We Accomplished

- Designed and implemented a **Severity Index** specifically for tropical events.
- This **Severity Index** was based off of four components previously defined.
- Built a set of **Python scripts** for data manipulation and visualization using libraries such as `xarray`, `matplotlib`, and `cartopy`. (and more)
- Created a **user-friendly interface** to visualize and interpret weather severity across multiple forecast hours.

## License
- We picked the MIT License for our project, which is suited for academic projects.
