The repository should include all of your project code, in addition to a README.md with
some amount of markdown customization (e.g. bullet points, header and subheader
fonts). The README should briefly describe your project (objectives, what you
accomplished) and list the group members. Be sure to pick a license


# Meteo473 Final Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and data for the **Meteo473 Final Project**, where we analyze ECMWF models to develop a severity index for tropical events. Our main goal was to pull certain data out of entire model runs, and display it in plots easier readability/ease of understanding.

### Objectives:
- Develop a custom **Severity Index** to assess the intensity of weather events.
- Implement data processing pipelines to handle large-scale weather forecast data.
- Use data visualization techniques to present findings and predictions effectively.

## What We Accomplished

- Designed and implemented a **Severity Index** that incorporates parameters like wind, precipitation, vorticity, and pressure.
- Built a set of **Python scripts** for data manipulation and visualization using libraries such as `xarray`, `matplotlib`, and `cartopy`.
- Created a **user-friendly interface** to visualize and interpret weather severity across multiple forecast hours.
